This module contains redux code (actions, reducer, state) and 
UI code created with [ReduxFX-View](https://github.com/netopyr/reduxfx)
for a simple todo list application. 

However, this module does not contain the startup code for
the application. For the startup code there are two other modules:

- [redux-java](../redux-java)
- [reduxfx](../reduxfx)

The *redux-java* module uses [jvm-redux-api](https://github.com/jvm-redux/jvm-redux-api) 
and [redux-java](https://github.com/glung/redux-java) library as redux implementations.

The *reduxfx* module uses [reduxfx-store](https://github.com/netopyr/reduxfx)
as redux implementation.
