# Redux-JavaFX-Devtool

A Devtool for Redux-like libraries (i.e. [ReduxFX](https://github.com/netopyr/reduxfx) or [Redux-Java](https://github.com/glung/redux-java)) for JavaFX.
The goal is to provide similar development features like the [redux-dev-tools](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension) do for redux.js.
