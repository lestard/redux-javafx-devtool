/*
 * gradle script to upload archives to maven central and Sonatype OSS
 *
 * How to use:
 * 1. copy the script file in the same directory like your build.gradle
 * 2. Embed the script in your build.gradle file underneath(!) your 'group' and 'version' definition with:
 *      apply from: "maven_upload.gradle"
 *
 *   It's important that the group and version information is above the 'apply' line. Otherwise these values aren't
 *   available in this build script.
 * 3. Add a gradle.properties file with information about your project that are used in the generated pom.xml file.
 *
 * This script uses the following properties:
 *
 *      project_name = <your project name>
 *      project_description= <a description of the project>
 *      project_url=<url to the project webpage>
 *      project_scm=<scm link, i.e. 'scm:git@github.com:username/project.git'>
 *      project_license_name= <name of the license>
 *      project_license_url= <url to the license text file>
 *      project_license_distribution=<how the license is distributed, typically 'repo'>
 *      project_developer_name=<the name of the developer>
 *     
 * 4. Configure sonatype repository credentials: Add the following properties to your ~/.gradle/gradle.properties file. 
 * 
 *      sonatypeUsername=YOUR USERNAME
 *      sonatypePassword=YOUR PASSWORD
 * 
 * This may <b>not</b> be added to the projects gradle.properties file because these are your private user credentials
 * that you don't want to be visible to the public.
 * 
 * Additionally we need to configure (again in ~/.gradle/gradle.properties) your GnuPG key that is used to sign the artifacts when you publish a release.
 * 
 *      signing.keyId=<your key id>
 *      signing.secretKeyRingFile=<path to keyring> # f.e. /home/superman/.gnupg/secring.gpg
 * 
 *
 * 5. Perform a snapshot release with:
 *      gradle uploadArchives -Psnapshot
 *
 * 6. Perform a regular release with:
 *      gradle uploadArchives -Prelease
 *
